Investigate a Dataset Project:


Mohammed Zayed Al-Otaibi



Introduction:

In this project, I went through the data analysis process and saw how everything fits together. I was analyzing a dataset by Python and communicated my findings of it*.


Dataset:
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue*.


Libraries:
- pandas.
- matplotlib.
- seaborn.
- numpy.

Investigate a Dataset:
- there are some columns not necessary, and I dropped it.
-I have 10866 records in this dataframe and some columns have a missing data if the data type of column is string I will replace by this sentence "No data".
- I dropped the duplicated rows, and total of them is one.
- I was transformed the data type of the following columns to date release_date & release_year.


Questions and Data Visualization:

Q1 : What is the relationship between budget and revenue for all movies?

the relationship between budget and revenue for all movies is strong and positive relationship because If the budgets of the movies are high we will be find the increase in revenue. And in the scatter plot below we notice that is a positive relation between the budgets of movies and revenue.
The correlation of relationship between budgets of movies and the revenue is : 0.7349279812889292 and it a strong positive linear relationship.
Ther are some outlier in revenues but we want to keep it in our statistics because is it very correct value and we want to deal with it because it is correct and very necessary, however we know that some movies earned very huge revenues and spread around the world***.


Q2 : Compare between the budgets and the revenue of the movies?

The box plot shows below high returns in the film industry of the world, It is true that there some outlier of data but we know that is a correct value because there are more than movie are made the huge successful on the world level, and make a huge revenue.
Finally there are very high revenues of movies that are more than the its budgets and this show us movies industry is very profitable business.
